    <p> It is hard to have just one favorite drink.  My drinks depend on the weather and the mood that I am in.  During the summer months I drink only refreshing drinks like pink lemonade, pink grapefruit, jamaica, and the popular ice tea with lots of ice.  My drinks in the winter are soft drinks, hot chocolate, and cappuccino.  If I am at a family gathering I like to have a cocktail just to go with my dinner.  Of all of these drinks only one stands on top for the pick of my favorite drink whick is water.</p>
